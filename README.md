Robotics Multimodal Deep Learning for Object Recognition


Applying CNN in to RGB-D dataset for fast and accurate object recognition 
Num of classes = 15
Used Libraries Tenforflow and Tensorlayer

Input Image size = (32,32) ïƒ  self.image_shape = (32,32)
No. of layers = 3
Inputs {X : RGB, X_depth: Depth Image

All layers are designed with tensorlayer and backend with tensorflow

        base = tf.constant_initializer(value=0.1)
        Weight = tf.truncated_normal_initializer(stddev=0.04)
